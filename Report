### Introduction/Business Problem
One of the first thing you do when looking to open a new venue is to find the right location for your business. To do so you might research different locations as well as research competitors in those locations.
Idea: Use Foursquare to gather information about different competitors in different locations and then predict some statistics for a new venue depending on category and location.

### Data
The data I will be using consists on a list of trending venues in a specific area. To each venue the following information:
-	Name
-	ID
-	Category
-	Location
-	Statistics
