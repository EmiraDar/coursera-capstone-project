### Introduction/Business Problem

I want to open a fast food restaurant in Berlin, and I am looking to find the best city for my new venue. 
For that I must do some research on different locations as well as competitors in those locations:
My location must be near to be near to offices, universities and schools to be sure having enough customers
but not too close to other competitors.

I will be using Foursquare to gather information about different competitors in different locations in Germany
and then predict some statistics for a new venue depending on restaurant category and location.

### Data

For my use case I will need the following data to determine which locality is the most appropriate for my new venue:
-	The coordinates (latitude, longitude) of Berlin
-	The Fast Food venues in Berlin
-	The offices venues in Berlin
-	The high schools, universities venues in Berlin
-	The shopping malls in Berlin
